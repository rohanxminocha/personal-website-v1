      <p>Hey, welcome to my corner of the internet!</p>
      <p>I'm a third year <strong>Computer Science</strong> student <s>studying</s> surviving at the <a class="underline-link" href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a> 📖</p>
      <p>I have over 12 months of total work experience, with major contributions in startup, enterprise and open source development teams 💻 For Winter 2023, I'm currently working as a <strong>Software Developer 🧑🏻‍💻</strong> at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.trustwave.com/" target="_blank">Trustwave</a> for my fourth internship, having just completed my 3A study term.</p>
      <p>Whether the internet or the outdoors, I love exploring, and I apply this open mindset to my projects. It allows me to solve problems by extracting valuable insights 💡 I’m interested in using my knowledge to create technologies that solve problems.</p>
      <p><strong>When I'm not working on assignments</strong>, I'm probably rewatching a movie or show <br>(rewatches >>> first watch) 🎥</p>
      <p>Some of my current interests include <strong>Cryptocurrency</strong>, <strong>Blockchain</strong> and exploring new cities with a coffee!</p>
