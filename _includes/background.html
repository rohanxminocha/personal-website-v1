    <p>
      I'm currently working as a Sofware Developer @ 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.elekta.com/" target="_blank">Elekta</a> fro my first co-op, building medical software with some awesome people. I am studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> @ 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m interested in creating technologies to solve problems, with the hopes of achieving a more inclusive digital world.
      
      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.
